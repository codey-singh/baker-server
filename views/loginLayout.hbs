  <meta name="description" content="Baker's Point is Toronto's premium online cake store. For us at Baker's Point
                    baking is not just a job, it is our passion. We do our best to ensure that every
                    single product sold from us is of the best quality made with the most important
                    ingredient LOVE. Baker's Point started in 2017 when our founder, an amateur
                    baker who was a college student at that time decided to sell her baked goodies
                    just for the sake of some pocket money. The business flourished over the years
                    and now we have a passionate team of bakers driven by our founder with the same
                    spirit as then." />
